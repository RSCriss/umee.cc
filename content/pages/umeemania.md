Welcome to Umeemania! If this is your first time participating in an Umee incentivized testnet, we’re thrilled to have you. And if you’re a seasoned veteran of our testnets, glad to have you back!

Since our last incentivized testnet, Umee has accomplished a lot - mainnet launch, token launch, web app launch, rebrand - just to name a few items. Now, we pivot to focus on the next upgrade of Umee: our native (Cosmos-based) lending module. 

We invite you to dive into Umee’s incentivized testnet to help us improve security and UX before implementing the mainnet upgrade. Become an Umeemaniac and join Umeemania by learning to use Umee’s cross-chain lending and borrowing functions, with a strong focus on IBC functionality, while having the opportunity to earn some [UMEE tokens](https://medium.com/umeeblog/umee-token-economics-cd15ef08f8be)!

## How It Works

**Umeemania participants are encouraged to contribute the highest total value locked (TVL) of assets onto [Umee](http://testnet.umee.cc).**

Total value locked (TVL) is the overall value of crypto assets deposited in a DeFi protocol. Testnet participants can increase their TVL contributions by strategically depositing, borrowing and depositing back various testnet tokens while maintaining healthy collateralization ratios to prevent liquidation. The Umee core team will be taking snapshots randomly to check individual TVL contributions and mark suspicious bot activities. *These snapshots will be used to determine token reward allocations later on.*

**Umeemania will be held on Umee’s current testnet, along with supported testnet tokens such as ATOM, OSMO, JUNO, and more to come.**

What’s more exciting than an incentivized testnet? Not much! The Umee team has plenty planned for the community. Umeemania participants will be able to test our native lending module for a chance to receive UMEE token rewards, weekly community events with a focus on Umee education, and some other surprises along the way. 

Excited? Great! Get ready to experience cross chain DeFi while earning some UMEE token rewards!

## What’s Needed to Participate?

- Must be using a laptop or pc;
- Must have an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet), e.g. Keplr;
- Must be an [Umee Discord](https://discord.gg/umee) member (to use testnet faucets);
- All Umeemania participants must [use a new Umee wallet address](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet#to-create-another-wallet-with-keplr).

## How to Participate

1. Make sure you have both an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) and an [Ethereum wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-ethereum-wallet) set up. Participants who previously had an Umee blockchain compatible wallet set up should [create a new account with a new wallet address](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet#to-create-another-wallet-with-keplr).
2. Follow the [testnet guides found here](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/umeemania-testnet) to connect to the web app, fund your wallets with testnet tokens, and start testing out Umee’s new features!

- [Cosmos (ATOM)](https://explorer.umeemania-1.network.umee.cc/cosmos)
- [Osmosis](https://explorer.umeemania-1.network.umee.cc/osmosis)
- [Juno](https://explorer.umeemania-1.network.umee.cc/juno)
- [Ethereum](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)

## Helpful Tips 
- Accumulating TVL through one wallet works better than using multiple wallets. Users who try to manipulate TVL by sending testnet tokens between wallets will not be eligible to earn UMEE token rewards!
- In this testnet, lending and borrowing will take place on both Cosmos and Ethereum.
- There is a **faucet within the [Umee Discord](https://discord.gg/umee)** to claim multiple testnet tokens; each testnet token can be claimed every 12 hours, and not all requests release the same amount of tokens!
- Participants can use their deposits as collateral to borrow in order to further increase their TVL contribution while simultaneously managing their risk.
- Pay attention to changes in interest rates and asset prices to maintain a healthy [LTV ratio](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics-1/defi-basics/lending-and-borrowing-in-defi#loan-to-value) and avoid getting [liquidated](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics-1/defi-basics/lending-and-borrowing-in-defi#liquidation)!

**UMEE token rewards will be distributed to select Umee wallet addresses at the conclusion of Umeemania. Reward structure details will be announced in the coming days. Rewards will be distributed in the form of [native UMEE tokens](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/umee-token/token-format). Learn how you can use native UMEE tokens [here](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/using-umee-tokens/using-native-umee-tokens).**
