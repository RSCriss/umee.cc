Welcome to UXmania! If this is your first time participating in an UX incentivized testnet, we’re thrilled to have you. And if you’re a seasoned veteran of our testnets, glad to have you back!

Since our last incentivized testnet, UX has accomplished a lot - mainnet launch, token launch, web app launch, rebrand - just to name a few items. Now, we pivot to focus on the next upgrade of UX: our native (Cosmos-based) lending module.

We invite you to dive into UX’s incentivized testnet to help us improve security and UX before implementing the mainnet upgrade. Become an UXmaniac and join UXmania by learning to use UX’s cross-chain lending and borrowing functions, with a strong focus on IBC functionality, while having the opportunity to earn some [UX tokens](https://medium.com/umeeblog/umee-token-economics-cd15ef08f8be)!

## How It Works

**UXmania participants are encouraged to contribute the highest total value locked (TVL) of assets onto [UX](http://testnet.umee.cc).**

Total value locked (TVL) is the overall value of crypto assets deposited in a DeFi protocol. Testnet participants can increase their TVL contributions by strategically depositing, borrowing and depositing back various testnet tokens while maintaining healthy collateralization ratios to prevent liquidation. The UX core team will be taking snapshots randomly to check individual TVL contributions and mark suspicious bot activities. _These snapshots will be used to determine token reward allocations later on._

**UXmania will be held on UX’s current testnet, along with supported testnet tokens such as ATOM, OSMO, JUNO, and more to come.**

What’s more exciting than an incentivized testnet? Not much! The UX team has plenty planned for the community. UXmania participants will be able to test our native lending module for a chance to receive UX token rewards, weekly community events with a focus on UX education, and some other surprises along the way.

Excited? Great! Get ready to experience cross chain DeFi while earning some UX token rewards!

## What’s Needed to Participate?

- Must be using a laptop or pc;
- Must create a NEW [UX Chain compatible wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet);
- All UXmania participants must [use a new UX wallet address](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet#to-create-another-wallet-with-keplr).

## How to Participate

1. Create a new [UX blockchain compatible wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) and an [Ethereum wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-ethereum-wallet). Users who would like to interact with UX’s Ethereum web app should also have an [Ethereum wallet](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/wallet-set-up/setting-up-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet#to-create-another-wallet-with-keplr) set up.
2. Follow the [testnet guides found here](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/umeemania-testnet) to connect to the web app, fund your wallets with testnet tokens, and start testing out UX’s new features!

- [Cosmos (ATOM)](https://explorer.umeemania-1.network.umee.cc/cosmos)

- [Juno](https://explorer.umeemania-1.network.umee.cc/juno)
- [Ethereum](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)

## Helpful Tips

- Accumulating TVL through one wallet works better than using multiple wallets. Users who try to manipulate TVL by sending testnet tokens between wallets will not be eligible to earn UX token rewards!
- In this testnet, lending and borrowing will take place on both Cosmos and Ethereum.
- There is a **faucet within the [UX Discord](https://discord.gg/umee)** to claim multiple testnet tokens; each testnet token can be claimed every 12 hours, and not all requests release the same amount of tokens!
- Participants can use their deposits as collateral to borrow in order to further increase their TVL contribution while simultaneously managing their risk.
- Pay attention to changes in interest rates and asset prices to maintain a healthy [LTV ratio](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics-1/defi-basics/lending-and-borrowing-in-defi#loan-to-value) and avoid getting [liquidated](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/blockchain-basics-1/defi-basics/lending-and-borrowing-in-defi#liquidation)!

**UX token rewards will be distributed to select UX wallet addresses at the conclusion of UXmania. Reward structure details will be announced in the coming days. Rewards will be distributed in the form of [native UX tokens](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/umee-token/token-format). Learn how you can use native UX tokens [here](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/user-guides/using-umee-tokens/using-native-umee-tokens).**

## About UX

_UX is a cross chain DeFi hub that interconnects between blockchains._

_As a base layer blockchain, applications and money lego primitives can be built on top of UX to access cross chain leverage and liquidity. The UX chain facilitates interoperability between the Cosmos ecosystem, Ethereum network, side chain architectures, layer two scaling solutions, and alternative base layer protocols. As a Cosmos SDK blockchain, the UX Network is interoperable with blockchains including Terra, Crypto.com, Binance Chain, Osmosis, Secret Network, and 30+ other chains, plus Ethereum, from Day 1._
